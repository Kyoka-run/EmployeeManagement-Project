   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kyoka-run/EmployeeManagement-Project.git

2. Set up the MySQL database:
   Open MySQL and create a new schema
   ```bash
   CREATE DATABASE employee_management;
   Update the application.properties file with your MySQL credentials:
   ```bash
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_management
   spring.datasource.username=YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME
   spring.datasource.password=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

3. Run the application

### Steps to Set Up the Front-End (React)

1. Install dependencies:
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install

2. Run the front-end application:
    Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
